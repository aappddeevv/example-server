Simple akka http based server.

Once you download the project run `sbt run` to run the server.

The server is designed to be easily changed so you can
add your own routes and responses to create a simple htttp
server for testing and learning purposes.

The file src/main/resources/application.conf has a few
parameters that can be changed.
